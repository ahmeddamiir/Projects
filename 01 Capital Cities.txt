Capital City Guessing Game

The program will load pairs of "Country Name" and "Capital City Name" from a file.

Txt file can be used - for example like this:

Czech Republic; Prague
Slovakia; Bratislava
France; Paris
Finland; Helsinki
Russia; Moscow

The user can then start one of two types of games:
1. The program will show the country and user has to write the city.
2. The program will show the city and user has to write the country.

The questions will be selected from the available data randomly.
After answering the question, the program will inform the user if
it was correct. In case the answer is wrong, the program will show correct answer.

The game can be stopped at any given time - for instance by using a keyword like "stop"
as the answer. After the game is stopped, the program will show total statistics
(number of correct and wrong asnwers - or percentage of success) and return to the
main menu.




BONUS:
1. Add continent for each data entry, and allow user to only play the game on chosen continent.
2. Add third game option, where the two game modes alternate randomly (program can give you
	country or city)
3. Make it, so that within the same "session" the player cannot get the same question multiple
	times.
