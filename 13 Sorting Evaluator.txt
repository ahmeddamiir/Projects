Sorting Evaluator

The program will load number from a file. There will be several (at least three)
sorting algorithms implemented (quick sort, bubble sort, select sort, merge sort etc).

The program will allow user to select which sorting algorithm they want to use for sorting,
sort the numbers and display the sorted results.

The program will also allow user to run evaluation - where every algorithm will be used on the same data
and the program will measure how quickly was each calculation done, and then display which algorithm was
the best (fastest).




BONUS:
1. Create option to perform exhaustive analysis - where the data will be randomly shuffled given
	number of times (for example 100 times) and the performance of sorting will be measured across
	all the different random inputs (calculate average speed)
