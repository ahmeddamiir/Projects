Could They Have Met

The program loads data about well known historical figures from a file.
It can be txt file that looks like this for example:

Albert Einstein; 1879; 1955
Winston Churchill; 1874; 1965
Fyodor Dostoevsky; 1821; 1881
Charlie Chaplin; 1889; 1977

The user can then start a game, where two random names are displayed and the user has
to guess if the two people couldve theoretically have met or not (if they was a point
in time, when they were both alive).

After they answer, the program will tell if the asnwer was correct or not and it will
show the years where the two people have lived.

The game can be stopped at any time (each time user has to guess, there are three options:
yes, no, exit).

After the game is stopped, the program will show user their score - how many questions they had
in total, how many correct answers they had, or what was their success rate percentage.

The program then returns to the main menu, where user can either start another game, or exit the program.




BONUS:
1. Make so that it program avoid pairings that are too obvious that they didnt live around the same time,
	for example, pairing like: Julius Caesar / Queen Victoria should be avoided, because they lived 1800 years
	apart.
2. Make it, so that within the same "session" the player cannot get the same question multiple
	times.
