Person Database

The program will load data about people (name, date of birth) from a file.
The file can be txt file that looks for example like this:

John Smith; 1987; 3; 25
Peter Johnson; 1994; 7; 12
Jenny King; 2002; 12; 17

The user can then:
1. diplay the whole database
2. search for a person by name, if they exists their information is shown
3. find the oldest / youngest person
4. display the upcoming birthays (for example three people who will have birthday
	in the nearest future, or display all birthays for the rest of the month)
	
	


BONUS:
1. allow adding / deleting people from the database, after any changes are made,
	the file is saved / overwritten with the new data
2. calculate advanced statistics (average age, which month are the most birthdays etc.)
