Anagrams

The program will load a database of words from a file.
Can be txt file where for instance each word in on separate line:

a
abandon
ability
able
about
above
abroad
absence

and so on (you can find vocabularies like this online)

The user can then type a word and the program will:
Show if the word is in the vocabulary.
Show all anagrams for the given word.




BONUS:
1. Turn the program into a game, where random word is given and user
	has to try to write as many anagrams as they can.
2. Calculate which is the biggest anagram "group" - which combination
	of letter produces the most correct words.
