In this example, the correct answer is stored as the first possible answer in the file.

The user can they start a game where a random question is displayed and the possible answers are displayed
as well (randomly). The user can then choose (use ABCD, or 1234) an answer.

The program will tell if they user was right or wrong, if they were wrong, correct answer is diplayed.

or by typing some special keyword like "stop" or "exit".




BONUS:
1. Make it, so that within the same "session" the player cannot get the same question multiple
	times.
2. Calculate some advanced statistics (number of correct answers throughout the game, or percentage)
3. Implement "hints" - user can ask for hint and two wrong options will be eliminated (similar to the rules
	of "Who wants to be a millionaire")
