Student Attendance

The program will load data about students and their attendance from a file.
It can be txt file that looks for example like this:

Johny Smith; 1; 0; 1; 0; 1; 0
Lucy Jenkins; 1; 0; 0; 1; 1; 1
Peter Johnson; 1; 1; 1; 1; 0; 1

the data can be 1/0, or true/false, or yes/no, or X/O - whichever you prefer

The user can then do one of the following:
1. view the whole attendance (every student and attendance)
2. enter student name and only attendance for that student is shown
3. find the best / worst student (based on how many times they were missing)
4. enter a limit for absences, and names of students were not missing more than the limit are shown
5. calculate percentage of absence for the whole class across all weeks
6. calculate percentage of absence on a weekly basis




BONUS:
1. Allow adding new weeks. If the uses decides to add new week, the program will display names
	of students and the user enters if that person is present or missing. Afterwards, the new data is
	stored (overwrite the original file so that it also has the data for the new week)
2. Give user option to sort students based on their attendance
