The program will load a text from a file. (you can download a book in txt book for testing purposes)

The user will have the option to do the following:
1. Display basic info (how many words, how many letter, how many sentences)
2. Display frequency analysis of letters - what is the percentage of each letter in the text
	(for example: a: 5,7%, b: 2,2%, c: 2,7% etc)
3. Display text based histogram for the frequency

The histogram can look for example like this:

a 5,7%   XXXXXXXXXXX
b 2,2%   XXXX 
c 2,7%   XXXXX
d 3,1%   XXXXXX
e 4,6%   XXXXXXXXX
