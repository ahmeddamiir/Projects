Math Practicer

The program will allow user to practice elementary level math.
(addition and substraction of two-digit numbers, multiplication of one digit numbers)

When the user starts the "game". A random math question will be generated, for example:

15 + 49 = ?

or

77 - 21 = ?

or

5 * 8 = ?

(make sure the substraction doesnt go into negative)
And the user can then write their answer.

The program will show if the asnwer is correct, and if not, the correct answer is shown.

The user can choose to stop the game at anytime, for example by typing special keyword like
"stop" or "exit". Overall results (how many correct answers / percentage) is shown and user is given
option to store their practice into an output file. The output file can look for example like this:

15 + 49 = 64 (correct)
77 - 21 = 55 (wrong, should be 56)
5 * 8 = 40 (correct)

After the practice is finished, the user can choose to start another game, or exit the program.




BONUS:
1. Make it, so that its possible to choose the difficulty (adding / substraction of three-digit numbers,
	multiplying two-digit numbers etc.)
2. Make it, so that user can decide to rerun a previous test - instead of questions being randomly generated,
	they questions will be copied from the output file of previous test
