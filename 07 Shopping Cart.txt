Shopping Cart

The program will load data about possible shopping items from a file.
The file can be txt file and contain names and prices for example like this:

apple; 15
bread; 14
beans; 25
milk; 12
pasta; 31
water; 6

The program will allow user to shop by adding items to the shopping cart. Possible items
in the store and their prices should be displayed. The user can then type what they want to buy and how many times.
For example:

What you want to buy?
apple
How many?
3

The items will then be added to a virtual shopping cart.

The user can:
1. add more items to the cart
2. see the contents of their cart, and current total price
3. empty the cart
4. see the shopping list
5. stop shopping (exit the program)




BONUS:
1. Make it so that repeated buys of same item do not show up in the shopping cart multiple times.
	For example, if I buy 5 apples and then buy 10 apples, the shopping cart will show 15 apples and
	not two seperate entries or 5 and 10.
2. Make it, so that the user can also save their shopping cart into an output file.
