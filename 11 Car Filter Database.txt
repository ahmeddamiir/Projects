Car Filter Database

The program will load data about cars (owner, model, manufacturer, year, color) from a file.
The file can be txt file that looks for example like this:

John Smith; Fiesta; Ford; 2000; green
Peter Johnson; Megane; Renault; 1997; blue

The user can then:
1. diplay the whole database
2. search for a person, if they have a car, information about the car is shown
3. filter cars by parameters 
	(for example show only cars of given color, show only cars from given manufacturer)
4. filter cars by age
	(for example show only cars that are 5 years old or newer)
5. calculate some statistics
	(most favourite model, average age, most favourite colour etc.)
	
	


BONUS:
1. allow adding / deleting cars from the database, after any changes are made,
	the file is saved / overwritten with the new data
2. add new parameters (price, miles per galon) and allow sorting based on these parameters
