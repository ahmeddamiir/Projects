Calendar

The program will load calendar with event from a file, the file can be txt
file that looks for example like this:

2021; 3; 5; 1230; Dentist
2021; 3; 5; 1830; Dinner with parents
2021; 3; 7; 1000; Submit weekly report
2021; 3; 28; 1200; Pay electricity bill

The user can then choose to:
1. Display nearest future events (today and tomorrow)
2. Show schedule for the current week (even past events)
3. Display future events until end of the month




BONUS:
1. Allow the data file to be unsorted (entries can be randomly mixed)
2. Allow user to create new event, add it to the calendar and save it
	(overwrite the original file, so that it also has the new event)
