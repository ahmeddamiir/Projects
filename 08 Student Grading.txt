Student Grading

The program will load data about students and their grades from a file.
It can be txt file that looks for example like this:

Johny Smith; 4; 4; 1; 3; 5; 2
Lucy Jenkins; 1; 2; 3; 1; 1; 1
Peter Johnson; 1; 1; 1; 1; 2; 1

The user can then choose to:
1. view the whole grading (every student and their grades)
2. enter student name and only grades for that student are shown
3. find the best / worst student (based on grade average)
4. enter a grade, and names of students who have better average are shown
5. calculate average for the whole class across all tests
6. calculate average for the whole class for a given test
	



BONUS:
1. Allow adding new tests / grading. If the uses decides to add new test, the program will display names
	of students and the user enters grades for each person for this new test. Afterwards, the new data is
	stored (overwrite the original file so that it has the added grades)
2. Allow multiple classes - so for example have one file with grades for Maths, one file with grades for
	Biology, one file for Chemistry etc... the user can choose which subject they want to "load"
3. Give user option to sort students based on their grades
