Questionnaire

The program will have two functionalities: 
1. filling out questionnares
2. finding aswers of a person

The user can choose to fill a new questionnare. Questions will be displayed
and the user can answer them, for instance:

What if your name?
How old are you?
What is your gender?
What country are you from?
What is your favourite color?

and so on. The questionnaire should have at least 10 questions.

After the user fills in the questionares, new file will be generated based on
their name and the answers will be stored in that file, for example:

John Smith.txt

John Smith
25
male
USA
green

The second functionality will allow user to type a person name, and if a file with
answers for that person exists, the program will show what they answered.




BONUS:
1. Instead of making a separate file for each questionnaire fill, store everything in
	a single "master" file.
2. Create option to calculate statistics - for instance average age of all the people who
	filled out the questionnaire.
3. Create checks for some of the answers - for example allow user to write only colors that exist
	by having a list of possible allowed answers. Same can be done for genders for example.
